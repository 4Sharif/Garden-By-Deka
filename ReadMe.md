# Garden By Deka 🌸
**Status:** Under Development

Welcome to **Garden By Deka** – a gardening blog created for TikTok star **Deka** (@ladybugs2002) to showcase all the work she put into her garden. All four pages share a consistent theme built with **HTM, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Pages

| # | Page | Content |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | **Home** | Welcome messages, contact links, a “Plant Fact of the Day” section that cycles through a local JSON file of hundreds of facts, and a “Plants of the Week” section. |
| 2 | **Tour** | Breaks the garden into key areas (garden beds, flower pots, decorations). Each area is shown with picture cards (image, title, description). |
| 3 | **Gallery** | Monthly highlight photos. A dropdown (month + year) lets visitors jump straight to that month’s section, where pictures can be browsed in a carousel format. |
| 4 | **About** | Tells the story of Deka and her garden and explains the purpose of the site. |
