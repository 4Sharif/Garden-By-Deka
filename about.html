            <h3>Who is Deka?</h3>
            <p>Deka is a passionate, hard-working gardener. After spending years perfecting her plants and crops, she doesn't plan on slowing down. As a mother of three, Deka treats her plants with the same care as her children. Every garden bed and flower pot receives consistent watering, new soil, relocation (if necessary), and any other care required to keep them alive and healthy. While some may view this work as overwhelming, Deka takes pride in building her garden because she sees growth from it every day. This place is a representation of who she is.</p>

            <h3>What is This Garden For?</h3>
            <p>There are many reasons why Deka wanted to build this garden. Seeing your hard work pay off is rewarding, and having a garden helps reduce stress, putting you in a better mental state. Another reason is to have healthier food options. Regardless of what brand-name companies say, it's always better to eat something you grew than to purchase food from the store. Plus, you'd be saving money on groceries because you could grow your food. One more reason is that you'd positively contribute to the environment. If being closer to nature wasn't enough for you, gardens provide essential habitats for pollinators, birds, and other wildlife, promoting biodiversity.</p>

            <h3>When Was This Garden Created and Where Is It?</h3>
            <p>Created in 2017, Deka has been working consistently to build this garden. Located in north Georgia, she's had the opportunity to work with great weather and buzzing wildlife.</p>

            <h3>Why Does This Garden Matter?</h3>
            <p>This garden matters because it showcases how far passion and diligence will take you. If you care about something, then you'll do everything right to make it work. Deka has always been passionate about gardening, and over the past decade, she's been able to turn her ideas into reality. Whether you're passionate about gardening or not, always try to give 100% effort into the things you love.</p>
